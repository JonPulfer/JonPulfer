### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I code for coin to pay for my sailing addiction...

- Comfortable writing in Go and Rust (as well as Ruby and a few other languages from time to time)
- Interests
  - Distributed Systems
  - Cloud systems
  - Event driven
  - Data streams
  - Cryptography

I enjoy learning and exploring things new to me. I like to share my skills and experiences with colleagues as well as learning from them.
